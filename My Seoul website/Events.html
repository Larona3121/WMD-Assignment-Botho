				<h1>Events And Festivals</h1>
				<p>Koreans seem to be able to make a celebration out of almost anything. A master of combining tradition with modernity, however quirky the result, Seoul is home to these unique festivals and customs.South Korea is a diverse and charming nation. Steeped in over 5,000 years of history and tradition, festivals are an important part of South Korean heritage.
Many traditional celebrations centre around myths and legends or the changing of the seasons. Ancient traditions practiced by farmers have taken on modern customs, while entirely new festivals have emerged for a new generation to enjoy.From Jinhae Gunhangje Cherry Blossom Festival in Busan to Jeju Fire Festival, here are the top festivals in South Korea.</p>
				<h3>Yeouido Spring Flower Festival</h3>
				<p>Many believe Japan is home to the most beautiful cherry blossom trees but when the weather gets warmer at the beginning of spring, Yeouiseo Street in Seoul transforms into a dreamland of pink and white. The Yeouido Spring Flower Festival is held in mid-April each year, when the azaleas, forsythia, royal azaleas and other spring flowers are in full bloom.Over a thousand blossoming cherry trees line the streets of Seoul, with hues of pink welcoming the arrival of Spring. As Seoul is a sprawling metropolis, the Yeouiseo-ro Road (Yunjung-no) – where the Yeouido Spring Flower Festival takes place – is closed off to vehicles, so visitors can enjoy the cherry blossom in a peaceful setting. There is also a great atmosphere at night, when the cherry blossoms are lit up and a wide range of street performances and exhibitions take place.   </p>
				<h3>Seoul Lotus Latern Festival</h3>
				<p> One of the most beautiful customs is paying respect to Buddha on his birthday. Various parts of Seoul are decorated with lanterns of all kinds creating a huge open-air lantern exhibition and an impressive parade is held leading from Dongdaemun Gate all the way to Jogyesa Temple.Seoul Lantern Festival is an annual festival held from the first Friday to the third Sunday of November. Each year, nearly 3 million visitors descend on Seoul’s Cheonggyecheon Plaza to see the kilometre stretch of Cheonggyecheon Stream illuminated with impressive lantern structures. There is a different theme each year, usually incorporating some elements of Korean culture. The lanterns are lit between 5 and 11 pm each night, so there is ample opportunity for visitors to wander through them before or after a traditional Korean meal of kimchi.</p>
				<h3>Go, Go Jongno Culture Festival</h3>
				<p>In fall, South Koreans take a journey back into the past with the Go, Go Jongno Culture Festival. The city is decked in green, red, blue and yellow, the traditional Korean colors. Celebrating the city’s 2,000 year history, visitors can enjoy various exhibitions on Korean art, food, including royal cuisine, music, and traditional clothing. The hotspots during the fall festivities are around Insa-dong and Cheonggyecheon Stream.</p>
				<h3>Seoul Kimchi Making & Sharing Festival</h3>
				<p>Kimchi is a fermented side dish made of vegetables, generally cabbage, prepared in a spicy chili sauce. Even though Koreans eat kimchi year round, it is usually prepared in winter and then left to ferment. Gimjang, the act of preparing kimchi in winter, is an important part of Korean culture and absolutely fascinating to watch as a visitor. In the beginning of November, the Seoul Kimchi Making & Sharing Festival is held at Seoul Plaza and in front of Gwanghwamun Square. Take part in the festivities and you will learn how to prepare kimchi and even sample over 200 varieties of this typical Korean side dish.</p>
				<h3>Seoul International Fireworks Festival</h3>
				<p>Every year, the people of Seoul get together in front of the 63 City Building in the city’s Hangang Park to enjoy an incredible firework display. Every year, professional firework teams from around the world head to Seoul to be part of one of the largest firework festivals in the world.</p>
